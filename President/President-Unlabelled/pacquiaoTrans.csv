@corbinstumon @sportscenter @espnringside @mannypacquiao @floydmayweather easy win.Simple
@Yungrizzle @sportscenter @espnringside @mannypacquiao @floydmayweather same result but a split decision would be the difference
@corbinstumon @sportscenter @espnringside @mannypacquiao @floydmayweather they weren't that old.If they were 25 it's the same fight and same results
@Sportscenter @espnringside @mannypacquiao @floydmayweather the anticipated fight of the century maybe .. surely want the fight of the century
"@Sportscenter @espnringside @mannypacquiao @floydmayweather mayweather nullified pacquiao made him look bang average.The same can't be said about Canelo, Floyd destroyed him so bad he nearly quit boxing altogether.Glad he learned from his defeat"
@Sportscenter @espnringside @mannypacquiao @floydmayweather this fight was a set up between both boxers for a big pay out and that is what they got.The sport of boxing has been sad since Mayweather has been running it.Now that he is retired hopefully the sport will get back to being entertaining.

"@Victorconte @monteroonboxing @boxingscene @mannypacquiao @keithfthurmanjr @vada_testing @pbcboxingchamp @tgbpromotions as I mentioned to you previously, no one wants to accept responsibility to pay for it.I understand it's expensive, but you either want a safer sport or you don't.There's nothing in between."
"@Victorconte @monteroonboxing @boxingscene @mannypacquiao @keithfthurmanjr @vada_testing @pbcboxingchamp @tgbpromotions The real root of this problem is that this sport remains a disorganized mess that allows for this lack of transparency.Full Testing & amp;Transparency should be mandated by all regulatory agencies, no exceptions."
"@Victorconte @monteroonboxing @boxingscene @mannypacquiao @keithfthurmanjr @vada_testing @pbcboxingchamp @tgbpromotions agree with you.But I won't be close to satisfied until there is full vada testing (or by a comparable competitor if a credible, competent one emerges) for every fighter.Valuing the Health & amp;Safety of certain boxers over others are simply unacceptable."

@from_140 @cinavenom @ivan497255522 @mannypacquiao @oscardelahoya I didn't say he was money his whole career.However Oscar gave him the big stage and the most money he has ever made.Therefore a second fight was even more money then the first.Besides the Pac2 fight would have the money fight.
"@from_140 @cinavenom @ivan497255522 @mannypacquiao @oscardelahoya yeah he did fight hatton in dec 2007 plans were to rematch in Sept of 2008 so oscar did the forbes fight May of 2008 to stay active.And then retirement announced and Oscar ended up Woth Pacquiao Dec 2008.

@rbzs_6 @lenirobredo @iskomoreno @iampinglacson @mannypacquiao that would be a good idea.And then each candidate can direct their statements and arguments to that empty chair to underscore his absence.
"@MyLovedohyun @daddyricks10 @yunicrimson why ping lacson, isko moreno, manny pacquiao and leody de guzman?You want us to choose men as well as BBM.
What do they have without BBM?
Say it straight.You just want a woman to win even for your sake of anti -Patriarchy."
@Pilstarngayon @philstarnews @mannypacquiao @iampinglacson @lenirobredo si cayetano nalang or the FBI will be the one in the debate

Create a game plan and use the CNN debate to expose Marcos.Direct all attacks against the one candidate trying to run away with it.Then let the chips fall whoever shines the most.One common point of attack for one night.@lenirobredo @iskomoreno @iampinglacson @mannypacquiao
Manny Pacquiao making more sense than ever.Lol
